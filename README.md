**<div align = "justify">Recommendation Engine Projects</div>**

<div align = "justify">This repository branch contains two projects focusing on building recommendation engines using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Project 1: Entertainment Recommendation Engine</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Overview</div>**
<div align = "justify">The Entertainment Recommendation Engine suggests movies based on their categories using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization method and cosine similarity for measuring similarity. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Features</div>**
<div align = "justify">Data Input: Reads movie data from a CSV file. </div>
<div align = "justify">TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts the movie categories into a TF-IDF matrix. </div>
<div align = "justify">Cosine Similarity: Computes the cosine similarity matrix from the TF-IDF matrix. </div>
<div align = "justify">Recommendations: Provides a function to recommend the top N similar movies based on a given movie title. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Project 2: Game Recommendation Engine</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Overview</div>**
<div align = "justify">The Game Recommendation Engine suggests games based on user ratings using the TF-IDF vectorization method and cosine similarity for measuring similarity. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Features</div>**
<div align = "justify">Data Input: Reads game data from a CSV file. </div>
<div align = "justify">TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts game descriptions into a TF-IDF matrix. </div>
<div align = "justify">Cosine Similarity: Computes the cosine similarity matrix from the TF-IDF matrix. </div>
<div align = "justify">Recommendations: Provides a function to recommend the top N similar games based on a given user ID. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Conclusion</div>**
<div align = "justify">These projects demonstrate the application of recommendation systems using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to provide personalized suggestions for movies and games. They can be further improved by incorporating user feedback and additional features like collaborative filtering. </div>
