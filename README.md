**<div align = "justify">Network Analytics Projects</div>**

<div align = "justify">This repository contains four network analytics projects using NetworkX, each analyzing different types of networks from various sources. The projects focus on understanding the structure and relationships within these networks by computing centrality measures and clustering coefficients. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Projects Overview</div>**

**<div align = "justify">1. Connecting Routes Analysis</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Dataset:** connecting_routes.csv</div>
**<div align = "justify">Description:** Analyzes routes between airports by constructing a network graph from source and destination airports. </div>

**<div align = "justify">2. Facebook Network Analysis</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Dataset:** facebook.csv</div>
**<div align = "justify">Description:** Builds a symmetric network of Facebook user connections and analyzes the structure of interactions. </div>

**<div align = "justify">3. Instagram Network Analysis</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Dataset: instagram.csv**</div>
**<div align = "justify">Description:** Visualizes Instagram user connections as a symmetric network and explores the relationships between users.</div>

**<div align = "justify">4. LinkedIn Network Analysis</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Dataset: linkedin.csv</div>**
**<div align = "justify">Description:** Creates a LinkedIn connection network and analyzes its structural properties. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Metrics Used Across All Projects</div>**

<div align = "justify">For each project, the following network metrics were computed to analyse the network structure: </div>

**<div align = "justify">Degree Centrality:** Measures the number of direct connections a node has. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Closeness Centrality:** Indicates how easily a node can reach other nodes in the network. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Betweenness Centrality:** Quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Eigenvector Centrality:** Measures a node’s influence based on the importance of its neighbours. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Clustering Coefficient:** Determines how closely nodes in a network tend to cluster together. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Average Clustering:** Provides the overall tendency of nodes to cluster in the network. </div>


**<div align = "justify">Conclusion: </div>**

<div align = "justify">Through the analysis of diverse networks—from airport routes to social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn—these projects demonstrate how centrality and clustering metrics can reveal important insights into the structure of complex networks. Degree centrality identifies the most connected nodes, while betweenness centrality highlights key bridges between clusters. The clustering coefficient shows how closely knit the networks are, providing a deeper understanding of the relationships within these systems. By applying the same techniques across different datasets, we gain a broader perspective on the dynamics of connected systems. </div>
