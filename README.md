**Association Rule Mining Projects:**
<div align = "justify">This repository contains four projects that apply association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm across different datasets. The goal of each project is to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules to explore interesting relationships within the data. </div>

**<div align = "justify"> Overview</div>**

**<div align = "justify"> Techniques Used:</div>**
**<div align = "justify">Apriori Algorithm:** To mine frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Association Rules:** To identify strong associations between items based on the lift metric. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Data Preprocessing:** Custom parsing and cleaning of datasets as needed. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Visualization:** Bar plots to display the most frequent itemsets. </div>
