**<div align = "justify">Principal Component Analysis Projects</div>**

**<div align = "justify">Overview</div>**
<div align = "justify">This repository contains two projects that utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze datasets related to heart disease and wine quality. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variance as possible. This is particularly useful for data visualization and feature reduction.

**<div align = "justify">1. Heart Disease Dataset Analysis</div>**
<div align = "justify">This project analyzes a heart disease dataset to identify patterns and groupings within the data. The steps include normalization, KMeans clustering, and PCA to reduce dimensionality while maintaining variance. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Steps: </div>**
**<div align = "justify">Data Loading:** Load the heart disease dataset.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Data Preprocessing:** Drop irrelevant features.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Normalization:** Normalize the numerical features for better clustering.</div>
**<div align = "justify">KMeans Clustering:** Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.</div>
**<div align = "justify">PCA Application:** Perform PCA on the normalized data.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Variance Analysis:** Analyze the variance explained by the PCA components.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Visualization:** Create scatter plots to visualize the clusters and PCA components.</div>

**<div align = "justify">Key Metrics: </div>**
<div align = "justify">Total Within Sum of Squares (TWSS)</div>
<div align = "justify">Explained Variance Ratio</div>
<div align = "justify">Cumulative Variance</div>

**<div align = "justify">2. Wine Quality Analysis</div>**
<div align = "justify">This project focuses on a wine quality dataset to explore relationships among features and classify wines based on their characteristics. The same methodology is applied as in the heart disease project.</div>

**<div align = "justify">Steps:**
**<div align = "justify">Data Loading:** Load the wine quality dataset.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Data Preprocessing:** Remove the target variable to focus on features.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Normalization:** Normalize the features for clustering.</div>
**<div align = "justify">KMeans Clustering:** Use the elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters.</div>
**<div align = "justify">PCA Application:** Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality.</div>
**<div align = "justify">Variance Analysis:** Investigate the variance explained by the PCA components. </div>
**<div align = "justify">Visualization:** Visualize the clustering and PCA results. </div>

**<div align = "justify">Key Metrics: </**
<div align = "justify">Total Within Sum of Squares (TWSS)</div>
<div align = "justify">Explained Variance Ratio</div>
<div align = "justify">Cumulative Variance</div>

**<div align = "justify">Conclusion</div>**
<div align = "justify">Both projects demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA in reducing dimensionality and uncovering patterns within complex datasets. By applying normalization, KMeans clustering, and variance analysis, insights were gained about the structure of the data and the relationships between features. The findings can assist in further analysis and predictive modeling efforts, contributing to more informed decision-making in health and quality assessments.</div>
